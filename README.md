<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The DockerWatch project is provide the convinence way to watch over multiple Docker hosts. Projcet to watch over docker host container and live logs -- I think this is it.

Gives visual representations of containers/images on the host system. DockerWatch will start running on port 8080. Currently, it shows info about docker engine running on a local machine. 

Here's why:
* View Container and image details of docker.
* Connect with multiple remote docker host.
* Perform some operations on docker host.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
